RocksDB configures a certain amount of main memory as a block cache to accelerate data access. Understanding the efficiency of block cache is very important. The block cache analysis and simulation tools help a user to collect block cache access traces, analyze its access pattern, and evaluate alternative caching policies.

# Quick Start
db_bench supports tracing block cache accesses. This section demonstrates how to trace accesses when running db_bench. It also shows how to analyze and evaluate caching policies using the generated trace file. 

Create a database: 
```
./db_bench --benchmarks="fillseq" \
--key_size=20 --prefix_size=20 --keys_per_prefix=0 --value_size=100 \
--cache_index_and_filter_blocks --cache_size=1048576 \
--disable_auto_compactions=1 --disable_wal=1 --compression_type=none \
--min_level_to_compress=-1 --compression_ratio=1 --num=10000000
```
To trace block cache accesses when running `readrandom` benchmark:
```
./db_bench --benchmarks="readrandom" --use_existing_db --duration=60 \
--key_size=20 --prefix_size=20 --keys_per_prefix=0 --value_size=100 \
--cache_index_and_filter_blocks --cache_size=1048576 \
--disable_auto_compactions=1 --disable_wal=1 --compression_type=none \
--min_level_to_compress=-1 --compression_ratio=1 --num=10000000 \
--threads=16 \
-block_cache_trace_file="/tmp/binary_trace_test_example" \
-block_cache_trace_max_trace_file_size_in_bytes=1073741824 \
-block_cache_trace_sampling_frequency=1
```
Convert the trace file to human readable format:
```
./block_cache_trace_analyzer \
-block_cache_trace_path=/tmp/binary_trace_test_example \
-human_readable_trace_file_path=/tmp/human_readable_block_trace_test_example
```
Evaluate alternative caching policies: 
```
bash block_cache_pysim.sh /tmp/human_readable_block_trace_test_example /tmp/sim_results/bench 1 0 30
```
Plot graphs:
```
python block_cache_trace_analyzer_plot.py /tmp/sim_results /tmp/sim_results_graphs
```

# Tracing Block Cache Accesses
RocksDB supports block cache tracing APIs `StartBlockCacheTrace` and `EndBlockCacheTrace`. When tracing starts, RocksDB logs detailed information of block cache accesses into a trace file. A user must specify a trace option and trace file path when start tracing block cache accesses.

A trace option contains `max_trace_file_size` and `sampling_frequency`.
- `max_trace_file_size` specifies the maximum size of the trace file. The tracing stops when the trace file size exceeds the specified `max_trace_file_size`.
- `sampling_frequency` determines how frequent should RocksDB trace an access. RocksDB uses spatial downsampling such that it traces all accesses to sampled blocks. A `sampling_frequency` of 1 means tracing all block cache accesses. A `sampling_frequency` of 100 means tracing all accesses on ~1% blocks. 

An example to start tracing block cache accesses: 
```
Env* env = rocksdb::Env::Default();
EnvOptions env_options;
std::string trace_path = "/tmp/binary_trace_test_example"
std::unique_ptr<TraceWriter> trace_writer;
DB* db = nullptr;
std::string db_name = "/tmp/rocksdb"

/*Create the trace file writer*/
NewFileTraceWriter(env, env_options, trace_path, &trace_writer);
DB::Open(options, dbname, &db);

/*Start tracing*/
db->StartBlockCacheTrace(trace_opt, std::move(trace_writer));

/* Your call of RocksDB APIs */

/*End tracing*/
db->EndBlockCacheTrace()
```

# Trace Format
We can convert the generated binary trace file into human readable trace file in csv format. It contains the following columns: 

| Column Name   |  Values     | Comment |
| :------------- |:-------------|:-------------|
| Access timestamp in microseconds     | unsigned long | |
| Block ID      |  unsigned long     | A unique block ID. |
| Block type | 7: Index block <br> 8: Filter block <br> 9: Data block <br> 10: Uncompressed dictionary block <br> 11: Range deletion block   | |
| Block size | unsigned long     | Block size may be 0 when <br> 1) compaction observes cache misses and does not insert the missing blocks into the cache. <br> 2) IO error when fetching a block. <br> 3) prefetching filter blocks but the SST file does not have filter blocks.  |
| Column family ID | unsigned long | A unique column family ID. | 
| Column family name | string   | |
| Level | unsigned long  | The LSM tree level of this block. |
| SST file number | unsigned long     | The SST file this block belongs to. | 
| Caller |  See [Caller](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/table/table_reader_caller.h) | The caller that accesses this block, e.g., Get, Iterator, Compaction, etc. |
| No insert | 0: do not insert the block upon a miss <br> 1: insert the block upon a cache miss   |  | 
| Get ID | unsigned long | A unique ID associated with the Get request. |
| Get key ID | unsigned long | The referenced key of the Get request. |
| Get referenced data size | unsigned long | The referenced data (key+value) size of the Get request. |
| Is a cache hit |  0: A cache hit <br> 1: A cache miss    | The running RocksDB instance observes a cache hit/miss on this block. |
| Get Does get referenced key exist in this block | 0: Does not exist <br> 1: Exist      | Data block only: Whether the referenced key is found in this block. |
| Get Approximate number of keys in this block | unsigned long | Data block only. |
| Get table ID | unsigned long     | The table ID of the Get request. We treat the first four bytes of the Get request as table ID. |
| Get sequence number | unsigned long | The sequence number associated with the Get request. |
| Block key size | unsigned long     |  |
| Get referenced key size | unsigned long     | |
| Block offset in the SST file | unsigned long  | |

# Cache Simulations
We support running cache simulators using both RocksDB built-in caches and caching policies written in python. The cache simulator replays the trace and reports the miss ratio given a cache capacity and a caching policy.

## RocksDB Cache Simulations
To replay the trace and evaluate alternative policies, we first need to provide a cache configuration file. An example file contains the following content: 
```
lru,0,0,16M,256M,1G,2G,4G,8G,12G,16G,1T
```
Cache configuration file format:

| Column Name   |  Values     |
| :------------- |:-------------|
| Cache name     | lru: LRU <br> lru_priority: LRU with midpoint insertion <br> lru_hybrid: LRU that also caches row keys <br> ghost_*: A ghost cache for admission control. It admits an entry on its second access.  |
| Number of shard bits      |  unsigned long     |
| Ghost cache capacity      |  unsigned long     |
| Cache sizes      |  A list of comma separated cache sizes      |

Next, we can start simulating caches. 
```
./block_cache_trace_analyzer -mrc_only=true \
-block_cache_trace_downsample_ratio=100 \
-block_cache_trace_path=/tmp/binary_trace_test_example \
-block_cache_sim_config_path=/tmp/cache_config \
-block_cache_analysis_result_dir=/tmp/binary_trace_test_example_results \
-cache_sim_warmup_seconds=3600
```

It contains two important parameters: 

`block_cache_trace_downsample_ratio`: The sampling frequency we used when collecting the trace. The simulator scales down the given cache size by this factor. For example, with downsample_ratio of 100, the cache simulator creates a 1 GB cache to simulate a 100 GB cache. 

`cache_sim_warmup_seconds`: The number of seconds used for warmup. The reported miss ratio does NOT include the number of misses/accesses during the warmup.

The analyzer outputs a few files: 
- A miss ratio curve file: `{trace_duration_in_seconds}_{total_accesses}_mrc`. 
- Three miss ratio timeline files per second (1), per minute (60), and per hour (3600). 
- Three number of misses timeline files per second (1), per minute (60), and per hour (3600). 

## Python Cache Simulations
We also support a more diverse set of caching policies written in python. In addition to LRU, it provides replacement policies using reinforcement learning, cost class, and more. To use the python cache simulator, we need to first convert the binary trace file into human readable trace file. 
```
./block_cache_trace_analyzer \
-block_cache_trace_path=/tmp/binary_trace_test_example \
-human_readable_trace_file_path=/tmp/human_readable_block_trace_test_example
```

block_cache_pysim.py options:
```
1) Cache type (ts, linucb, arc, lru, opt, pylru, pymru, pylfu, pyhb, gdsize, trace). 
One may evaluate the hybrid row_block cache by appending '_hybrid' to a cache_type, e.g., ts_hybrid. 
Note that hybrid is not supported with opt and trace. 
2) Cache size (xM, xG, xT).
3) The sampling frequency used to collect the trace. 
(The simulation scales down the cache size by the sampling frequency).
4) Warmup seconds (The number of seconds used for warmup).
5) Trace file path.
6) Result directory (A directory that saves generated results)
7) Max number of accesses to process. (Replay the entire trace if set to -1.)
8) The target column family. (The simulation will only run accesses on the target column family. 
If it is set to all, it will run against all accesses.)
```
One example:
```
python block_cache_pysim.py lru 16M 100 3600 /tmp/human_readable_block_trace_test_example /tmp/results 10000000 0 all 
```
We also provide a bash script to simulate a batch of cache configurations: 
```
Usage: ./block_cache_pysim.sh trace_file_path result_dir downsample_size warmup_seconds max_jobs

-max_jobs: The maximum number of simulators to run at a time.
```
One example: 
```
bash block_cache_pysim.sh /tmp/human_readable_block_trace_test_example /tmp/sim_results/bench 1 0 30
```
block_cache_pysim.py output the following files: 
- A miss ratio curve file: `data-ml-mrc-{cache_type}-{cache_size}-{target_cf_name}`. 
- Two files on the timeline of miss ratios per minute (60), and per hour (3600). 
- Two files on the timeline of number of misses per second (1), per minute (60), and per hour (3600). 
For `ts` and `linucb`, it also outputs the following files: 
- Two files on the timeline of percentage of times a policy is selected:  per minute (60) and per hour (3600). 
- Two files on the timeline of number of times a policy is selected: per minute (60) and per hour (3600). 

block_cache_pysim.sh combines the outputs of block_cache_pysim.py into following files: 
- One miss ratio curve file per target column family: `ml_{target_cf_name}_mrc`
- One files on the timeline of number of misses per `{target_cf_name}{capacity}{time_unit}`: `ml_{target_cf_name}{capacity}{time_unit}miss_timeline`
- One files on the timeline of miss ratios per `{target_cf_name}{capacity}{time_unit}`: `ml_{target_cf_name}{capacity}{time_unit}miss_ratio_timeline`
- One files on the timeline of number of times a policy is selected per `{target_cf_name}{capacity}{time_unit}`: `ml_{target_cf_name}{capacity}{time_unit}policy_timeline`
- One files on the timeline of percentage of times a policy is selected per `{target_cf_name}{capacity}{time_unit}`: `ml_{target_cf_name}{capacity}{time_unit}policy_ratio_timeline`

| *_hybrid | A hybrid cache that also caches row keys. |

`py*` caches uses random sampling at eviction time. It samples 64 random entries in the cache, sorts these entries based on a priority function, e.g., LRU, and evicts from the lowest priority entry until the cache has enough capacity to insert the new entry.

`pycc*` caches group cached entries by a cost class. The cache maintains aggregated statistics for each cost class such as number of hits, total size. A cached entry is also tagged with one cost class. At eviction time, the cache samples 64 random entries and group them by their cost class. It then evicts entries based on their cost class's statistics. 

`ts` and `linucb` are two caches using reinforcement learning. The cache is configured with N policies, e.g., LRU, MRU, LFU, etc. The cache learns which policy is the best overtime and selects the best policy for eviction. The cache rewards the selected policy if it has not evicted the new key before. 
`ts` does not use any feature of a block while `linucb` uses three features: a block's level, column family, and block type. 

`trace` reports the misses observed in the collected trace. 

# Analyzing Block Cache Traces
The `block_cache_trace_analyzer` analyzes a trace file and outputs useful statistics of the access pattern. It provides insights into how to tune and improve a caching policy. 

The `block_cache_trace_analyzer` may output statistics into multiple csv files saved in a result directory. We can plot graphs on these statistics using `block_cache_trace_analyzer_plot.py`.
